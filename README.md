# Week4_ExploratoryViz

This is an ipynb project that takes UK's 2021 Covid 19 vaccination data in CSV and produces line graphs showing the trends over time with regards to their vaccination status.

Started using line-by-line coding and refactored using for-loop to optimize the processing and reduces the line of codes.
